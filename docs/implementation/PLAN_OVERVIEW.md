# Job Search AI - Implementation Plan Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the implementation plan for the Job Search AI system. For a detailed, chunk-by-chunk breakdown, see [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md).

## Overview

The implementation is organized into sequential phases, where each phase builds upon the last. Each phase is broken down into smaller "chunks" that are independently testable and leave the codebase in a working state. This approach allows for incremental development and testing.

## Implementation Phases & Chunks

The project is broken down into the following major phases and their constituent chunks:

### Phase 0: Foundation
- **Chunk 0.1: Project Setup & Dependencies**: Initialize project structure, install dependencies, create basic configuration system.
- **Chunk 0.2: Database Models & Migrations**: Set up SQLAlchemy models, database session management, Alembic migrations.
- **Chunk 0.3: Core Pydantic Models**: Implement core Pydantic models for type safety throughout application.

### Phase 1: Provider System
- **Chunk 1.1: Provider Discovery Mechanism**: Implement dynamic provider discovery via directory scanning with importlib.
- **Chunk 1.2: Mock Provider for Testing**: Create a simple mock provider to validate discovery and loading system.
- **Chunk 1.3: Settings & Configuration Loading**: Integrate settings loading with FastAPI dependency injection.

### Phase 2: Job Search Basics
- **Chunk 2.1: Job Aggregation Service**: Implement service to aggregate jobs from multiple sources in parallel.
- **Chunk 2.2: Duplicate Detection**: Implement duplicate job detection across multiple sources.
- **Chunk 2.3: Basic Search API Endpoint**: Create API endpoint that uses aggregation service (no research yet).

### Phase 3: First Real Provider (Indeed Integration)
- **Chunk 3.1: Indeed API Client Setup**: Create Indeed job source provider with real API integration.
